      (cac) Why does this need to be at the individual client level for
      CARE+? Why can't the system aggregate all the policy modifiers and
      simply list them for the policy itself? Is this too fine-detailed
      for the CARE+ API?
      (cac) This is truly POLICY information and need to be modeled at
      the policy level, not the CLIENT level.
