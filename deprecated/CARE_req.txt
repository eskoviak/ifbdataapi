CRM Users need the abilty to view detailed information on the CARE+ Screens. As a CRM User I need the ability to review current and accurate active policy information with the client/customer to verify that the information is correct, coverage is appropriate and adequate at time of loss,  and offer up-sell, and cross sell opportunities.


Coverage translation-Any symbols or codes will be translated to meaningful  verbiage to client.

Detailed information needs to be displayed for Client Demographic, Membership and all Lines of business with active policies.
