Additionally, one OR more filters MAY be added to the query to describe the desired relationship. This allows the consumer to narrow the request, filtered by the businessObject, _e.g._ `CLM`, `MEMB`, `LIFE` etc. The returned resource will then contain a specific collection of interests tied to the requested businessObject(s).\n\nThe following URI fragment demonstrates the use of the optional _OR_ filter (selects those interests whose businessObject property values are 'MEMB' OR 'MESL'):\n\n`.../api/client-interests?clientId=YZZZZZSFF030CLTCTCN3&businessObject=MEMB&businessObject=MESL`\n\n#### Diagrams\n![Interaction](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/sd-client-interests%401-7.png)\n![ClientInterest Model](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/Interest%20Instance.png)\n\n#### Known Implementations\nLDC Client Lookup\n\n**Note:**\n\nSpecial Behavior for : businessObject = `MESL`\nWhen `MESL` is specified as a businessObject in the filter, the api returns the interest resource for the identified client, as well as the interest resources for all of the members of the household to which that client belongs (as a collection).\n\n#### Performance Expectation\nTBD\n\n#### Service Capacity Supported\nTBD\n\n#### Suggested Test Scenario\nTBD\n\n#### Service Availability\nTBD\n\n#### Service Security\nTBD\n","contact":{"name":"Enterprise Web Services Team","email":"EWSDevelopers@infambureau.com","url":"http://connections/issite/ews/SitePages/Home.aspx"}},"schemes":["http","https"],"consumes":["application/json"],"produces":["application/json"],"paths":{"/":{"get":{"summary":"Get interests for client","description":"Given the recordkeeping client identifier and filter criteria, provide the collection of intersts which satisfy the query.\n","parameters":[{"name":"clientId","in":"query","description":"record-keeping system identifier","required":true,"type":"string"},{"name":"businessObject","in":"query","description":"The business object filter.","required":false,"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"collectionFormat":"multi"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Success.\n","schema":{"description":"An object which relates two objects via type and id.
