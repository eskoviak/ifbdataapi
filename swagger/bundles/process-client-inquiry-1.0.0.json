This inquiry consists of two categories of information:\n\n_Some combination of client demographic information_\n\n* First Name\n* Last Name\n* Date of Birth\n* Tax ID (SSN)\n\nA _business filter to focus the inquiry_: This filter is an array of name/value pair objects.  In the current client record-keeping system (Exceed), the relationship of a client to a particular policy is termed a `business object`.   The filter is used to limit the inquiry to one _OR_ more business objects to which the client has a relationship to.\n\n#### Service Functionality\nThis service sits in the [process layer](http://connections/issite/iCAF/SitePages/Home.aspx) exposing the inquiry functionality to the experience layer users.\n\n#### Sequence Diagram\n![client-inquiry](http://connections/issite/EWS/SiteAssets/experience-client-inquiry.png)\n\nThe client uses HTTP POST with the desired query fields in the request body, using the JSON format detailed in the request specification.  The Process Layer assembles the data, using the client identifying information and applying the desired filter.  Upon completion of the data gathering process(es); a JSON encoded body is returned as the requested resource.\n\n#### Known Implementations\n* Life Death Claims (LDC)\n\nThe following demographic information combinations are supported:\n\n* Last Name\n* Last Name, First Name\n* Last Name, Date of Birth\n* Tax Id\n\nThe supported business filters are Primary and Select Memberships.\n\n_ Sample Claim inquiry using the Client's first/last name_\n\n[JSON Request](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/client-inquiry-request-response/client-inquiry-firstlastname-CLM-rq.json.txt) --> [JSON Response](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/client-inquiry-request-response/client-inquiry-firstlastname-CLM-rs.json.txt)\n\n_Sample Life Death Claim inquiry using the Client's first/last name_\n\n[JSON Request](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/client-inquiry-request-response/client-inquiry-firstlastname-LDC-rq.json.txt) --> [JSON Response](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/client-inquiry-request-response/client-inquiry-firstlastname-LDC-rs.json.txt)\n\n_Sample Life Death Claim inquiry using on the Client's last name_\n\n[JSON Request](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/client-inquiry-request-response/client-inquiry-lastname-LDC-rq.json.txt) --> [JSON Response](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/client-inquiry-request-response/client-inquiry-lastname-LDC-rs.json.txt)\n\n### Individual/Business/Account Client Inquiry:\n\nThis is the process entry point for individuals (client) searches against the client record-keeping system (Exceed).\n\n#### Service Functionality\nThis API is called with a JSON payload of search parameters.
