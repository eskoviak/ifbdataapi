Additionally, one OR more filters MAY be added to the query to describe the desired relationship. This allows the consumer to narrow the request, filtered by the businessObject, _e.g._ `CLM`, `MEMB`, `LIFE` etc. The returned resource will then contain a specific collection of interests tied to the requested businessObject(s).\n\n`.../EnterpriseClientInterestsApi/interests/?clientId=SOME_CLIENT_ID`\n\n#### Performance Expectation\nTBD\n\n#### Service Capacity Supported\nTBD\n\n#### Suggested Test Scenario\nTBD\n\n#### Service Availability\nTBD\n\n#### Service Security\nTBD\n","contact":{"name":"Enterprise Web Services Team","email":"EWSDevelopers@infambureau.com","url":"http://connections/issite/ews/SitePages/Home.aspx"}},"schemes":["http","https"],"consumes":["application/json"],"produces":["application/json"],"host":"ap-tcsoaa-dev.infarmbureau.com:8082","basePath":"/EnterpriseClientInterestsApi/interests","paths":{"/":{"get":{"summary":"Get interests for client","description":"Given the recordkeeping client identifier and filter criteria, provide the collection of intersts which satisfy the query.\n","parameters":[{"name":"clientId","in":"query","description":"record-keeping system identifier","required":true,"type":"string"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Success.\n","schema":{"description":"An object which relates two objects via type and id.
