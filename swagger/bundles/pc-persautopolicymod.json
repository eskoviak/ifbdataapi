{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"version":"1.0.0","title":"pc-persautopolicymod","description":"This API is used to initiate a transfer of automobile insurance coverage from one vehicle to another.  It is intended to provide process layer access (See [here](http://connections/issite/iCAF/SitePages/Home.aspx) for a description of this architecure) to a self service front end.  The API has been designed to be a framework which is reusable, allowing future personal automobile insurance transactions to be added.\n\n#### Service Functionality\nThis service is built on top of the existing Exceed COM framework and the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).  This framework is deployed on the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB); the framework provides a layer of abstraction which exposes the Exceed application via an external API.\n\nUsing the Exceed COM framework, this service orchestrates the necessary calls to the record-keeping system, wrapping the ACORD transactions as necessary.  This exposes the same functionality, to effect a change in the vehicle policy, as would be available to a Customer Service Representative via the exceed application.\n\n![Vehicle Transfer](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/sd-pc-persautotransfer.png)\n\n#### Known Implementations\n_Vehicle Transfer_\n\n#### Example XML\n| Requests | Responses |\n| --- | ---|\n| [Free Form Vehicle Info](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/pc-persautotransfer/requests/Has_FreeformEnteredVehicleInfo.xml) | [Has Vehicle Questions Change](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/pc-persautotransfer/requests/Has_VehicleQuestionsChange_NO.xml) |\n| [Has Vehicle Coverge Change](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/pc-persautotransfer/requests/Has_VehicleCoverageChange.xml) | |\n| [Has Vehicle Interest Change](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/pc-persautotransfer/requests/Has_VehicleInterestsChange.xml) | |\n| [Has Vehicle Questions Change NO](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/pc-persautotransfer/requests/Has_VehicleQuestionsChange_NO.xml) | |\n| [Has Vehicle Questions Change YES](http://connections/issite/ews/SiteAssets/pc-persautotransfer/requests/Has_VehicleQuestionsChange_YES.xml) | |\n\n    \n#### Performance Expectation\nTBD\n\n#### Service Capacity Supported\nTBD\n\n#### Suggested Test Scenario\nTODO:  Get with Scott on this\n\n#### Service Availability\nTBD\n\n#### Service Security\nTBD\n","contact":{"name":"Enterprise Web Services","email":"ewsdevelopers@infarmbureau.com","url":"http://connections/issite/ews/SitePages/Home.aspx"}},"basePath":"/camel","schemes":["http","https"],"consumes":["application/xml"],"produces":["application/xml"],"paths":{"/":{"post":{"summary":"SOAP Call to ESB","description":"Exposes a SOAP endpoint for clients to request a vehicle transfer\n","consumes":["application/xml"],"produces":["application/xml"],"parameters":[{"name":"PolicyModInXML","in":"body","description":"The SOAP XML Request body.","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"The SOAP XML Response body.","schema":{"type":"file"}}}}}}}
