  title:  client-interests
  description: |
    This API is used to get detailed information concerning the client's interests.

    #### Service Functionality
    An interest is a business relationship between the client and a policy (contract), such as the _owner_, _annuitant_, the _insured_ or the _driver_.

    The API uses the internal record-keeping system identifier to locate the client information.  Additionally, one OR more filters MAY be added to the query to describe the desired relationship.

    The following URI fragment demonstrates the use of the optional _OR_ filter (selects those interests whose businessObject property values are 'MEMB' OR 'MESL'):

    `.../api/client-interests?clientId=YZZZZZSFF030CLTCTCN3&businessObject=MEMB&businessObject=MESL`
