  title: PersAutoTransfer
  description: |
    This API is used to initiate a transfer of automobile insurance coverage from one vehicle to another.  It is intended to provide system and process (See [here]() for a description of this architecure) layer access to a self service front end.

    #### Service Functionality
    Using the Exceed COM framework, this service orchestrates the necessary calls to the record-keeping system, wrapping th ACORD transactions as necessary.  This exposes the same functionality used by the CSR to effect a change in the covered vehicle.

    #### Performance Expectation
    TBD

    #### Service Capacity Supported
    TBD

    #### Suggested Test Scenario
    TODO:  Get with Scott on this

    #### Service Availability
    TBD

    #### Service Security
    TBD
