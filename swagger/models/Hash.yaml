  A model for a name:value pair.  Used whenever a data item is needed which only has a name and value.  This will eventually be used for:
  * Limits
  * Deductibles
  * Discounts
  * Exposures

  Note:  The name is required but nullable.  The parent's name may be enough to tag this item.
required:
  ['name', 'value']
properties:
  name:
    type: ['string', 'null']
  value:
    type: ['string', 'number']
