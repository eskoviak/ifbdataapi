  A client object represents a party to the insurance policy or annuity contract.  A client can be
  either a person (i.e. the insured or the annuitant), an organization (i.e. a bank or assignee), or
  it can be Unknown (i.e. a trust, which can be either a person or an organization).  The client is
  related to the policy/contract through the use of the Interest model, which acts as a link
  between the two objects.
