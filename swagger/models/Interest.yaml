  An object which relates two objects via type and id.  Consider two objects, such as Policy and Client.  A policy is owned by a client.  In this case, the root objectType is Policy, with it's policyId. The child objectType is Client, with it's clientId.  The relationshipType is owner:  Policy --> Owner --> Client.  
  
  Note that codes or a text description may be used to represent the three parts (root, child, relationship) of the Interest.  In all three cases, either a type (string) or typeCode (string) is required.
